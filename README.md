# Crossmatching-astronomical-catalogues

The purpose of this project is to calculate the distance between different astronomical catalogues (images of sky patches) and then calculate and plot their relative positions.
For this purpose, firstly I loaded the given text data of the images and measured the distance between each of the given points of every 2 image catalogues.
Then, calculated the maximum amount of distances available among them using histogram for some certain bin widths.
Then derived a matrix to measured the relative distance among the catalogues and plotted their positions.
